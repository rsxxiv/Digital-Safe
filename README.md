# Digital-Safe
Digital Safe Implementation using Arduino Uno R3

This is a group project that I made during my 4th semester in Design and Thinking Lab.
It was fun to make though we faced many design and technical chalanges as this was the first time we made a functional project using Arduino uno R3.
This project uses a Keypad \(4*4\), a Piezoelectric Buzzer, a Servo Motor \(9g\), PIR sensor, Breadboard and a lot of Jumper Wires.
You could try to make this on your own and if you face any issues, feel free to contact me, I am happy to help :\)
